# Status checks summary
# This workflow ensures:
# 1. Code follows style guidelines (Black, Flake8, isort)
# 2. All unit tests pass on multiple Python versions
# 3. Code coverage meets minimum threshold
# 4. No security vulnerabilities are introduced
# 5. Application builds and imports successfully
# 6. Deployment only occurs when all checks pass on main branch
